# DOT PRODUCTS
This repository contains two code snippets in different programming languages:

1. C Code (dot_product.c):


This C code calculates the dot product of two integer arrays. The `dot_product` function takes two integer arrays (`vec1` and `vec2`) along with their size (`n`) as input and returns the dot product of the two arrays. The `main` function initializes two integer arrays, `vec1` and `vec2`, with sample values and then calls the `dot_product` function to calculate the dot product of these arrays. Finally, it prints the result.

2. Python Code (dot_product.py):


This Python code performs the same task as the C code: calculating the dot product of two arrays. The `dot_product` function takes two lists (`v1` and `v2`) as input, ensuring they are of the same length, and then computes the dot product. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `dot_product` by passing sample lists and printing the result.

Both code snippets achieve the same functionality but are implemented in different programming languages: C and Python.
